In 2013 & 2014 this rapper had a monster hit with "The Monster", featuring Rihanna
In 1973 this brother & sister duo were on top of the charts with "Top Of The World"
In 1971 this soulful man followed up "Tired Of Being Alone" with the No. 1 hit "Let's Stay Together"
This reggae group does well with covers: their versions of "Red Red Wine" & "Can't Help Falling In Love" hit No. 1
It is my belief that this Scott Stapp rock group had a No. 1 hit with the 2000 song "With Arms Wide Open"
